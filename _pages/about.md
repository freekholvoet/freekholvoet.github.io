I am Freek, a PhD researcher in actuarial science at KU Leuven, under the supervision of Prof. Katrien Antonio. During my studies in mathematics and actuarial science, I gained practical experience at Delta Lloyd Life Insurance in Brussels, followed by nearly eight years specializing in risk modeling before returning to academia.

My research focuses on insurance data science, combining actuarial methods with machine learning to address practical challenges in non-life insurance. I am particularly interested in developing interpretable models for pricing, incorporating various types of geographical data to improve portfolio management, and advancing techniques for modeling complex dependencies and multi-peril risks.
